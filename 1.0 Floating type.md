- Go compiler will infer that days is a `float64`, even if you don’t specify it
- Whenever the value is a number with a decimal point, the type will be `float64`.
```go
days := 365.2425 
var days = 365.2425 
var days float64 = 365.2425
// in each case `days` is of `float64`
```

- The default floating-point type is `float64`, a 64-bit floating-point type that uses **eight bytes of memory**
- Some languages use the term double precision to describe the 64-bit floating-point type
- The `float32` type uses half the memory of float64 but offers less precision. This type is sometimes called single precision.

## Zero value
- In Go, each type has a default value, called the zero value. The default applies when you declare a variable but don’t initialize it with a value
```go
var price float64 
fmt.Println(price)
```
The previous listing declares price with no value, so Go initializes it with zero. To the computer, it’s identical to the following: 
`price := 0.0`

## Displaying floating-point types
- you can use Printf with the `%f` for matting verb to specify the number of digits, as the following listing shows.
```go
third := 1.0 / 3 
fmt.Println(third) 
fmt.Printf("%v\n", third) // Prints 0.3333333333333333
fmt.Printf("%f\n", third) // Prints 0.333333
fmt.Printf("%.3f\n", third) // Prints 0.333
fmt.Printf("%4.2f\n", third) // Prints 0.33
```

- The `%f` verb formats the value of third with a **width** and with **precision**
- Precision specifies how many digits should appear after the decimal point; two digits for `%.2f`
- Width specifies the minimum number of characters to display, including the decimal point and the digits before and after the decimal (for example, 0.33 has a width of 4). If the width is larger than the number of characters needed, Printf will pad the left with spaces
- To left-pad with zeros instead of spaces, prefix the width with a zero, as in the following listing.
```go
fmt.Printf("%05.2f\n", third) // 00.33
```

## Rounding errors
- To minimize rounding errors, we recommend that you perform multiplication before division. The result tends to be more accurate that way
- Instead of comparing floating-point numbers directly, determine the absolute difference between two numbers and then ensure the difference isn’t too big
```go
fmt.Println(math.Abs(piggyBank-0.3) < 0.0001)
```

**Summary**
- Go can infer types for you. In particular, Go will infer float64 for variables initialized with real numbers. 
- Floating-point types are versatile but not always accurate. 
- You used 2 of Go’s 15 numeric types (`float64`, `float32`).
