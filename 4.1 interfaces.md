### Brief Notes on Interfaces and Passing Values in Go

#### What are Interfaces?

In Go, an interface is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. A type satisfies an interface if it implements all the methods declared by the interface. Interfaces allow you to write flexible and reusable code by defining behaviors that can be implemented by different types.

**Any code can by updated with interfaces**
#### Example Code

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

type stardater interface {
	YearDay() int
	Hour() int
}

func stardate(t time.Time) float64 {
	doy := float64(t.YearDay())
	h := float64(t.Hour()) / 24.0
	return 1000 + doy + h
}

func stardate2(t stardater) float64 {
	doy := float64(t.YearDay())
	h := float64(t.Hour()) / 24.0
	return 1000 + doy + h
}

func rand(a int64) {
	// Function implementation
}

func main() {
	day := time.Now()
	fmt.Println(stardate(day), stardate2(day)) // both give same output

	var something interface {
		Hour() int
		YearDay() int
	}

	something = day

	a := int32(4)
	rand(int64(a)) // Convert int32 to int64
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Interfaces**:
   - The `stardater` interface defines two methods: `YearDay()` and `Hour()`.
   - Any type that implements these methods satisfies the `stardater` interface.

2. **Passing Values to Functions**:
   - The `stardate` Function accepts a `time.Time` Value directly.
   - The `stardate2` function accepts any value that satisfies the `stardater` interface.

3. **Assigning Values to Interface Variables**:
   - In the `main` function, `day` is of type `time.Time`
   - A variable `something` is declared with an anonymous interface type that requires `Hour()` and `YearDay()` methods.
   - The `day` value is assigned to `something` Because `time.Time` implements both `Hour()` and `YearDay()` methods, satisfying the interface.

4. **Type Conversion**:
   - The `rand` function accepts an `int64` Value.
   - An `int32` value `a` is explicitly converted to `int64` before being passed to the `rand` Function.

#### Key Points

- **Interfaces in Go**: Interfaces define a set of method signatures. A type satisfies an interface if it implements all the methods declared by the interface.
- **Passing Values to Functions**: You can pass values to functions that accept interfaces if the values satisfy the interface.
- **Assigning Values to Interface Variables**: You can assign values to variables of interface type if the values satisfy the interface. This works for function parameters as well.
- **Type Conversion**: Explicit type conversion is required when passing values of different types to functions.

#### Example of Interface Satisfaction

```go
day := time.Now()
var something interface {
	Hour() int
	YearDay() int
}

something = day // this works fine (This also works in function passing, we can pass `day`, where `something` is expected)

a := int32(43)
var b int64
b = a // this would give us an error (Thus cannot be passed in function, we cannot pass `a` where `b` is expected)
```

In this example:
- `day` Is of type `time.Time`
- `something` is an interface variable that requires `Hour()` and `YearDay()` methods.
- `day` Is assigned to `something` Because `time.Time` implements both `Hour()` and `YearDay()` methods, satisfying the interface.

This concept also applies to function parameters. If a function accepts an interface type, you can pass any value that satisfies the interface to that function.

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively use interfaces and pass values in Go, making your code more flexible and reusable.

# Limitations
When something is converted to an interface, you can only call methods from it, thus to do something more substantial, you need to convert it back, it can be done using *type assertions*
