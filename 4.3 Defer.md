In Go, when you have multiple [defer](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/maddi/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insiders/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) statements in a function, they are executed in **last-in, first-out (LIFO)** order. This means that the last [defer](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/maddi/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insiders/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) statement you write will be the first one to be executed when the function returns.

### Example

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("First defer")
    defer fmt.Println("Second defer")
    defer fmt.Println("Third defer")

    fmt.Println("Function body")
}
```

**Output**
```
Function body
Third defer
Second defer
First defer
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Body**:
    
    - The `fmt.Println("Function body")` statement is executed first.
2. **Deferred Statements**:
    
    - The `defer fmt.Println("Third defer")` statement is executed last because it was deferred last.
    - The `defer fmt.Println("Second defer"` statement is executed second to last.
    - The `defer fmt.Println("First defer")` statement is executed first among the deferred statements because it was deferred first.

### Applying to Your Code

In your provided code snippet, if you had multiple `defer` statements, they would be executed in reverse order of their appearance:
