```go
func main() {
    a := "hello"
    fmt.Printf("type %T, value %[1]v\n", a)

    b := 42
    fmt.Printf("type %T, value %[1]v\n", b)

    c := 3.14
    fmt.Printf("type %T, value %[1]v\n", c)

    d := true
    fmt.Printf("type %T, value %[1]v\n", d)
}
```

## Big numbers
It gets interesting when you declare a constant without a type. For variables, Go uses type infer ence to determine the type, and in the case of 24 quintillion, overflows the int type. Constants are different. Rather than infer a type, constants can be untyped. The following line doesn’t cause an overflow error: 

`const distance = 24000000000000000000`

Calculations on constants and literals are performed during compilation rather than while the program is running. The Go compiler is written in Go. Under the hood, untyped numeric constants are backed by the big package, enabling all the usual operations with numbers well beyond 18 quintillion

constants and `big.Int` values aren’t interchange able. Listing 8.2 displayed a `big.Int` containing 24 quintillion, but you can’t display the distance constant due to an overflow error

**Summary**
- When the native types can’t go the distance, the big package has you covered. 
- Big things are possible with constants that are untyped, and all numeric literals are untyped constants too. 
- Untyped constants must be converted to typed variables when passed to functions.
