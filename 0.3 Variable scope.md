## Scope in GO
- In Go, scopes tend to begin and end along the lines of curly braces {}

```go
package main 
import ( 
	"fmt" 
	"math/rand" 
) 
func main() { 
	var count = 0 // Scope is entire main function
	for count < 10 { 
		var num = rand.Intn(10) + 1 // num is only valid inside this for loop
		fmt.Println(num) count++ 
	} 
}
```

## Short variable declaration and scope in GO
- Printing random valid date in GO
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func isLeapYear(year int) bool {
	if year%400 == 0 {
		return true
	} else if year%100 == 0 {
		return false
	} else if year%4 == 0 {
		return true
	}
	return false
}

func printRandomDate(year int) {

	var monthInfeb int
	if isLeapYear(year) {
		monthInfeb = 29
	} else {
		monthInfeb = 28
	}

	switch month := rand.Intn(12) + 1; month {
	case 2:
		day := rand.Intn(monthInfeb) + 1 // this day is only valid for this case scope
		fmt.Printf("%v/%v/%v\n", day, month, year)
	case 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12:
		day := rand.Intn(31) + 1
		fmt.Printf("%v/%v/%v\n", day, month, year)
	default:
		day := rand.Intn(30) + 1
		fmt.Printf("%v/%v/%v\n", day, month, year)
	}
}

func main() {
	printRandomDate(2024)
}
```
`month` variable was declared in the switch statement, and its scope it the entire switch block.

In Go, the initialization statement in an `if` / `switch` statement can include variable declarations and assignments. However, it must be a single statement. You cannot include multiple statements separated by semicolons within the initialization part of the ` if ` / `switch` statement.

Here's an example of what you can do:
```go
if month := rand.Intn(5); month > 1 {
    // Your code here
} else if month > 2 {
	// something else
} else if month > 3 {
	// something else
} else {
	// something else
}
```
`month` variable would be valid for the entire if-else block (*it kind of violates the braces principle, but as `month` variable is declared before the conditional statement is evaluated, so it stays is scope for the entire `if-else` ladder*)
```go
if month := rand.Intn(5); month++; month > 4 {  
} // INVALID CODE
```

- **It’s not possible to declare a variable with `var` immediately after the `if`, `switch`, or `for` keywords. Without short declaration, `num` would need to be declared before the if/switch statement, so `num` would remain in scope beyond the end of if/switch.**

- `something` is declared for the `package`, **we cannot declared `something` is short declaration T_T**
```go
var something int = 5

func main() {   
}
```

**Summary**
- An opening curly brace `{` introduces a new scope that ends with a closing brace `}`.
- The `case`  and `default` keywords also introduce a new scope even though no curly braces are involved.
- The location where a variable is declared determines which scope it’s in.
- Not only is shortcut declaration shorter, you can take it places where `var` can’t go.
- Variables declared on the same line as a `for`, `if`, or `switch` are in scope until the end of that statement.
- A wide scope is better than a narrow scope in some situations—and vice versa
