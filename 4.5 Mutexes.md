# Mutex

A **Mutex** (mutual exclusion lock) in Golang is used to prevent multiple goroutines from accessing shared data at the same time. It ensures that only one goroutine can access a critical section of code at a time, avoiding race conditions. Mutexes are especially useful when dealing with concurrent programming in Golang, where multiple goroutines might try to modify shared variables concurrently.

Golang provides `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex` for this purpose:
- **`sync.Mutex`** allows only one goroutine to access the critical section at a time.
- **`sync.RWMutex`** allows multiple readers or one writer, but not both.

### Basic Example of a Mutex

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

var (
    counter int       // Shared resource
    mutex   sync.Mutex // Mutex to synchronize access
)

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    mutex.Lock()        // Lock the mutex before accessing shared resource
    counter++           // Critical section
    fmt.Println("Counter:", counter)
    mutex.Unlock()      // Unlock the mutex after accessing shared resource
    wg.Done()           // Notify the WaitGroup that goroutine is done
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go increment(&wg)  // Start multiple goroutines
    }

    wg.Wait()             // Wait for all goroutines to complete
    fmt.Println("Final Counter Value:", counter)
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`mutex.Lock()`**: Locks the mutex so only one goroutine can enter the critical section.
- **`mutex.Unlock()`**: Unlocks the mutex after the shared resource has been safely modified.
- Multiple goroutines increment the shared `counter`, but only one can modify it at a time due to the mutex, ensuring no race conditions.

### Output:
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
Final Counter Value: 5
```

This ensures safe concurrent access to shared data across multiple goroutines.

## When to Use a Mutex in Golang

A **Mutex** (mutual exclusion lock) is needed when multiple goroutines need to access shared resources, but we want to prevent them from modifying these resources concurrently, which could lead to race conditions.

Here’s a breakdown of when and how to use a Mutex:

### 1. Writing to a Shared Resource:
   - **When to Use a Mutex**: Always use a mutex when writing to a shared resource. This is because concurrent writes can lead to data corruption or race conditions.
   - **Example**: If multiple goroutines are incrementing a shared counter or modifying a map, a mutex is needed to ensure that only one goroutine writes at a time.
   - **Code**:
     ```go
     mutex.Lock()
     sharedVariable = sharedVariable + 1
     mutex.Unlock()
     ```

### 2. Reading from a Shared Resource:
   - **When to Use a Mutex**: If multiple goroutines are only reading the shared resource (and no writing happens), no mutex is needed. However, if reading happens **while** another goroutine is writing to the resource, use a mutex to prevent reading incomplete or inconsistent data.
   - **Code**:
     ```go
     mutex.Lock()
     value := sharedVariable  // Reading safely
     mutex.Unlock()
     ```

### 3. Simultaneous Reads and Writes:
   - **When to Use a Mutex**: If both reading and writing happen concurrently, a mutex is required. This ensures that no read operation happens while a write is in progress and no write happens while reading.
   - **Optimized Option**: Use a **`sync.RWMutex`**, which allows multiple concurrent reads but only one write. The `RLock` and `RUnlock` methods are used for read operations, while `Lock` and `Unlock` are used for write operations.
   - **Code**:
     ```go
     var rwMutex sync.RWMutex

     // Reading
     rwMutex.RLock()
     value := sharedVariable
     rwMutex.RUnlock()

     // Writing
     rwMutex.Lock()
     sharedVariable = sharedVariable + 1
     rwMutex.Unlock()
     ```

#### General Guidelines:
- **Use a Mutex for writes**: Always lock the mutex when modifying shared data to ensure safety.
- **Mutex for reads**: If reads can occur concurrently with writes, protect reads with a mutex or `RWMutex`.
- **No need for mutex**: When only reading from shared resources without any writes happening at the same time, a mutex is not required.

By properly using mutexes, you can avoid race conditions and ensure the integrity of shared data in your concurrent programs.

## Race Conditions in Golang

A **race condition** occurs when two or more goroutines access shared data concurrently, and at least one of them is writing to the shared data. Without proper synchronization, the outcome of these operations can be unpredictable, leading to inconsistent results or unexpected behaviors.

For example, if two goroutines try to increment a shared variable at the same time, the following can happen:

- **Goroutine A** reads the current value of the variable (say it's `5`).
- Before **Goroutine A** finishes updating the value to `6`, **Goroutine B** also reads the value as `5` and tries to update it.
- Both goroutines end up setting the value to `6`, even though it should have been incremented twice and become `7`.

### Example of a Race Condition:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

var counter int

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    counter++ // Critical section without synchronization
    wg.Done()
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go increment(&wg)
    }

    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Final Counter Value:", counter) // Output may vary, e.g., 3 instead of 5
}
```

### Explanation of the Race Condition:
- Multiple goroutines are incrementing the shared `counter` variable concurrently.
- Since there’s no synchronization (like a mutex), two goroutines can access and modify `counter` at the same time, leading to inconsistent final values.

### How Mutex Solves Race Conditions:
By using a **Mutex**, we ensure that only one goroutine can modify the shared variable at any given time, preventing other goroutines from reading or writing simultaneously. This eliminates the race condition and ensures consistent and correct results.

In Golang, a **`WaitGroup`** is used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish their execution. It helps synchronize the main function with the concurrently running goroutines, ensuring that the main program doesn't exit before the goroutines complete their work.

<hr>
## How WaitGroup Works:

- **`wg.Add(n)`**: Tells the `WaitGroup` that there are `n` goroutines to wait for.
- **`wg.Done()`**: Called by each goroutine when it finishes. This decreases the counter in the `WaitGroup` by 1.
- **`wg.Wait()`**: Blocks the execution of the main function until the `WaitGroup` counter becomes zero (i.e., all goroutines have called `wg.Done()`).

### In the Code Example:
- **`wg.Add(1)`** is called before launching each goroutine to tell the `WaitGroup` that there's one more goroutine to wait for.
- Inside each goroutine, **`wg.Done()`** is called after the goroutine completes its task to signal that it's finished.
- **`wg.Wait()`** is called in the main function to block until all the goroutines have finished executing.

Without `WaitGroup`, the main function might exit before the goroutines complete, leading to incomplete or inconsistent output. The `WaitGroup` ensures that the main function waits for all goroutines to finish before proceeding.
