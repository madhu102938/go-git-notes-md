- The individual letters, digits, and symbols are called characters. When you string together characters and place them between quotes, it’s called a literal string.
- To avoid substituting \n for a new line, you can wrap text in backticks $`$
- Backticks indicate a raw string literal

## Unicode
- The Unicode Consortium assigns numeric values, called code points
- To represent a single Unicode code point, Go provides `rune`, which is an alias for the `int32` type
- A `byte` is an alias for the `uint8` type. It’s intended for binary data, though byte can be used for English characters defined by ASCII, an older 128-character subset of Unicode.

- but strings in Go aren’t susceptible to manipulation. A variable can be assigned to a different string, but strings themselves can’t be altered:
- Strings in Go are *immutable*

### Brief Notes on Indexing in Strings and Accessing Bytes vs. Runes in Go

#### Indexing in Strings

In Go, strings are sequences of bytes. Indexing a string allows you to access individual bytes. This is useful for operations that need to manipulate or inspect the raw byte data of a string.

**Example: Accessing Bytes in a String**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    str := "hello"
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        fmt.Printf("Byte at index %d: %c\n", i, str[i])
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Byte at index 0: h
Byte at index 1: e
Byte at index 2: l
Byte at index 3: l
Byte at index 4: o
```

#### Accessing Runes in a String

Runes represent Unicode code points and are used to handle characters that may be more than one byte in size. To access runes in a string, you can use the `range` keyword, which iterates over the string and provides the index and the rune at each position.

**Example: Accessing Runes in a String**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    str := "hello, 世界"
    for i, r := range str {
        fmt.Printf("Rune at index %d: %c\n", i, r)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Rune at index 0: h
Rune at index 1: e
Rune at index 2: l
Rune at index 3: l
Rune at index 4: o
Rune at index 5: ,
Rune at index 6:  
Rune at index 7: 世
Rune at index 10: 界
```

#### Differences Between Bytes and Runes

- **Bytes**: Directly represent the raw data of the string. Each byte is a single element of the string's underlying byte array.
- **Runes**: Represent Unicode code points and can be more than one byte in size. They are used to correctly handle characters that are not part of the ASCII set.

**Code Example: Bytes vs. Runes**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    str := "hello, 世界"

    // Accessing bytes
    fmt.Println("Bytes:")
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        fmt.Printf("Byte at index %d: %x\n", i, str[i])
    }

    // Accessing runes
    fmt.Println("\nRunes:")
    for i, r := range str {
        fmt.Printf("Rune at index %d: %c\n", i, r)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Bytes:
Byte at index 0: 68
Byte at index 1: 65
Byte at index 2: 6c
Byte at index 3: 6c
Byte at index 4: 6f
Byte at index 5: 2c
Byte at index 6: 20
Byte at index 7: e4
Byte at index 8: b8
Byte at index 9: 96
Byte at index 10: e7
Byte at index 11: 95
Byte at index 12: 8c

Runes:
Rune at index 0: h
Rune at index 1: e
Rune at index 2: l
Rune at index 3: l
Rune at index 4: o
Rune at index 5: ,
Rune at index 6:  
Rune at index 7: 世
Rune at index 10: 界
```

### Summary

- **Indexing in Strings**: Allows access to individual bytes.
- **Accessing Runes**: Use the `range` keyword to handle Unicode characters correctly.
- **Difference**: Bytes are raw data, while runes represent Unicode code points and can be multiple bytes in size.
## For loop vs for each
```go
func main() {
    var something rune = 960
    name := "madhu"
    somethingelse := name + string(something)
    
    fmt.Println(somethingelse) // madhuπ
    
    for i := 0; i < len(somethingelse); i++ {
        fmt.Printf("%c", somethingelse[i]) // madhuÏ
    }
    fmt.Print("\n")
    
    for _, i := range somethingelse {
        fmt.Printf("%c", i) // madhuπ
    }
}
```

- The `len` function returns the length of a string in bytes

**Summary**
- Escape sequences like `\n` are ignored in raw string literals ($`$). 
- Strings are immutable. Individual characters can be accessed but not altered. 
- Strings use a variable length encoding called UTF-8, where each character consumes 1–4 bytes. 
- A byte is an alias for the `uint8` type, and rune is an alias for the `int32` type. 
- The range keyword can decode a UTF-8 encoded string into runes
